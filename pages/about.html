				<h3>What is Sneedacity?</h3>
				<p>Sneedacity is an audio recording and editing suite forked from Audacity. However, unlike Audacity we have removed all methods of telemetry and collection of user data from the source code. Consequently, Sneedacity is free, open source, and respects user's privacy. Moreover, Sneedacity is in active development to extend functionality beyond that of Audacity.</p>

				<h3>Where does the name come from?</h3>
				<p>"Sneed" comes from episode 5 of season 11 of The Simpsons, E-I-E-I-D'oh (or E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)). Sneed (and the sign it appears on, Sneed's Feed and Seed (Formerly Chuck's) is a meme that has become very popular on 4chan (especially amongst the "blue," or "Safe-For-Work," boards). Some reference to "Sneed" is always incorporated into the names of our software.</p>
        
				<h3>Why Sneed? Why not something more serious?</h3>
				<p>During the vote to name an audacity fork, the name "Sneedacity" won by a large margin. Memes are fun, as is contributing to free and open source software. Consequently, Sneedacity is a way support free software, without taking things too seriously.</p>

				<h3>Is Sneedacity free and open source?</h3>
				<p>Yes, Sneedacity is free (as in speech) and open source. You are free to run or alter the program as you wish, study and alter the source code, and redistribute your modified code. Moreover, Sneedacity respects user privacy. We do not include telemetry, trackers, or any form of data collection in our software.</p>

				<h3>What projects are you working on (or have completed)?</h3>
				<p>Currently, the list of projects we are working on are Sneedacity (audio-manipulation tool based off of Audacity), and SIMP (image-manipulation tool based off of GIMP). Hear more about our projects and software by going to the "Projects" tab in the navigation bar.</p>

				<h3>How did you get started? What is /g/?</h3>
				<p>We started working on our first project, Sneedacity, on the imageboard 4chan's /g/ board, which is the section of the forum dealing with technology (mainly computer science). We decided to fill the niche in the market when we learned that many people were looking for a derivative of Audacity that did not send data to the company that owns the software (a version that did not include "spyware").</p>
